"""Combine every collected batch into one master emissions dataset.

Companies were searched in batches of ~50 (data/batches/batch_NN.csv,
plus a small hand-verified seed file). This script reads all of them,
keeps the first row seen for any ticker that appears more than once, and
writes the result to data/environmental_emissions_master.csv -- the
single file every later pipeline stage builds on. Prints per-file row
counts and a breakdown by data_source (cdp_pdf / sustainability_report /
epa_ghgrp / none) so a re-run's output is easy to sanity-check."""
