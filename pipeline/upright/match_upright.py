"""
Match the teammate's Upright Project "Net Impact Model" export
(data/upright_final_esg.json, 505 companies) to our S&P 500 ticker
roster, and pull out only the columns useful for merging into one
dataset -- not the full JSON (narrative explanations, scrape metadata,
duplicate screener_* fields, per-sub-metric detail).

This is a DIFFERENT dataset from anything else in this pipeline: Upright
measures modeled, monetized impact in "cents per dollar of revenue"
across four categories (Environment, Health, Knowledge, Society) --
NOT physical Scope 1/2 tCO2e tonnage. Do not treat its "GHG emissions"
cost figure as comparable to or a substitute for scope1_tco2e /
scope2_*_tco2e elsewhere in this repo. It's included here as its own,
separately-labelled columns for the teammate's pillar work, not folded
into the Level/Velocity/Integrity emissions columns.

Same conservative matching philosophy as sbti/match_sbti.py and
climate_trace/match_climate_trace.py: exact normalized company name
only, no fuzzy/substring matching. Upright's JSON has no ticker field,
only a company name (e.g. "WALMART", "ALPHABET") -- so an unmatched
name (e.g. dual-class listings like GOOG/GOOGL, whose constituent
"Security" name includes "(Class A)"/"(Class C)") is left out entirely
rather than guessed.
