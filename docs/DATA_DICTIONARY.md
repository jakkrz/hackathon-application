# Data dictionary — every output file, column by column

This project produces three files a consumer might actually use. This
doc covers all three:

1. [`environmental_combined.csv`](#environmental_combinedcsv--column-reference) — every raw collected/estimated input, one row per ticker. The file to use if you want the underlying numbers.
2. [`environmental_scores.csv`](#environmental_scorescsv--column-reference) — the final computed Level/Velocity/Integrity/Composite score per ticker. The file to use if you just want the score.
3. [`sp500_metrics.json`](#sp500_metricsjson--structure-reference) — everything above, reshaped as nested JSON for a website to consume directly.

For the exact formulas behind `environmental_scores.csv`, see
`docs/SCORE_METHODOLOGY.md` — this doc tells you what each column means,
that one tells you how it was computed and why.

## `environmental_combined.csv` — column reference

One row per S&P 500 ticker (503 rows total, including a few dual-class
listings like GOOG/GOOGL). Built by `pipeline/build_combined_dataset.py`
from six sources joined on `ticker`:

- **Level input, real** (`environmental_emissions_master.csv`, built by
  `pipeline/pdf_extraction/merge_batches.py`) — real disclosed Scope 1/2 tonnage,
  collected from CDP PDFs, sustainability reports, and EPA GHGRP.
- **Level input, estimated** (`pipeline/tier2_estimation/tier2_estimates.csv`,
  built by `pipeline/tier2_estimation/estimate_tier2.py`) — for tickers
  with no real number at all, a sector-median emissions-intensity
  estimate scaled by the company's own revenue/employees, modeled on
  LSEG's published carbon-estimate methodology. **Never overwrites a real
  number** — only ever fills a ticker with zero real Scope 1/2 data.
- **Velocity input** (`pipeline/sbti/sbti_matches.csv`, built by
  `pipeline/sbti/match_sbti.py`) — Science Based Targets initiative
  target status, matched by exact normalized company name.
- **Integrity input** (`pipeline/climate_trace/climate_trace_matches.csv`,
  built by `pipeline/climate_trace/match_climate_trace.py`) — independent,
  satellite/sensor-based confirmation (not self-reported) that a company
  owns Power-sector physical assets Climate TRACE also tracks.
- **Upright input, a separate teammate dataset** (`pipeline/upright/upright_matches.csv`,
  built by `pipeline/upright/match_upright.py` from `data/upright_final_esg.json`)
  — the Upright Project's "Net Impact Model": a modeled, **monetized**
  cost/benefit score in cents per dollar of revenue, across Environment,
  Health, Knowledge, and Society categories. **This is a fundamentally
  different unit than everything else in this file** — not tCO2e, not
  comparable to or a substitute for the Level columns. Merged in purely
  because it's the teammate's data and the two need to live in one file;
  every column is prefixed `upright_` for that reason.
- **Upright input, PROXY ESTIMATED** (`pipeline/upright/upright_estimates.csv`,
  built by `pipeline/upright/estimate_upright_gaps.py`) — for the ~33
  tickers Upright's export has no real record for at all, a peer-median
  proxy: the median of each cents-per-dollar-of-revenue metric among real
  Upright-covered peers in the same GICS sector/sub-industry. **This is
  OUR OWN modeled proxy, not Upright's actual methodology or output** —
  Upright computes company-specific activity-based scores, this is a much
  cruder industry-average stand-in. Tagged `upright_is_estimated=True`;
  never overwrites a real Upright match; never present this as if Upright
  itself produced it.

This file holds **raw collected inputs, not computed scores** — it is not
`level_score`, `velocity_score`, or `integrity_score`. Turning these
numbers into those scores (sector-relative normalization, weighting
against a science-based pathway, etc.) is separate, later work.

**Every estimated row is tagged `is_estimated=True`.** This is the
column to key any color-coding or visual distinction off of when
displaying this data — real and estimated Scope 1/2 figures should never
look the same on a chart or table without that flag being visible
somewhere (a badge, a footnote marker, a distinct color — whatever fits
the actual display).

## Quick numbers (as of the 2026-09-13 collection pass)

- **All 503 / 503 companies now have BOTH a Scope 1 and a Scope 2 figure
  — full coverage on each scope independently** (sixth pass, 2026-09-13).
  Scope 1 and Scope 2 are estimated **independently** of each other, not
  as a combined total split by share like earlier passes of this
  pipeline: a company can have a real Scope 1 and an estimated Scope 2
  side by side (or vice versa), each with its own `scope1_is_estimated`/
  `scope2_is_estimated` flag.
  - **Scope 1**: 247 real + 256 Tier 2 estimated = 503, 0 blank.
  - **Scope 2**: 164 real (market-based preferred, else location-based)
    + 339 Tier 2 estimated = 503, 0 blank.
  - This replaced an earlier, cruder version of this model that only
    ever estimated when a ticker had **neither** scope disclosed at all
    (254 companies) — which silently left **87 companies** with a real
    number for one scope and a totally blank other scope (85 with real
    Scope 1/no Scope 2, 2 with real Scope 2/no Scope 1) uncovered. Those
    87 are now correctly filled from a scope-specific peer pool (peers
    with a *real* value for that specific scope, not the other one).
  - The old combined `is_estimated` column is kept for backward
    compatibility (`True` if either scope is estimated) — but
    `scope1_is_estimated`/`scope2_is_estimated` are the columns to
    actually use now for per-scope color-coding.
- **A real bug was found and fixed while verifying this data (2026-09-13,
  second pass)**: 7 `epa_ghgrp` rows (3M, Albemarle, Baxter, Biogen,
  BlackRock, Brown-Forman, Delta Air Lines) had `data_source=epa_ghgrp`
  and a fully-formed match note, but a **blank `scope1_tco2e`** — the
  real number was sitting right there in `epa_ghgrp_matches.csv` the
  whole time, it just never got written into these 7 specific batch-file
  rows during an earlier session. All 7 were backfilled with their real
  EPA figures, which correctly moved them out of the Tier 2 estimate pool
  (they're real Level data now) and added them to the Tier 1 peer pool
  used to compute everyone else's sector-median estimates — worth
  knowing if a number you saw earlier for one of these 7, or for a
  Tier-2-estimated peer in the same sector, has since shifted slightly.
- **The last gap (Fiserv, `FISV`) was closed in a third pass (2026-09-13)**:
  Yahoo's `.info` endpoint returns null revenue/employees for this ticker
  (likely fallout from Fiserv's 2023 `FISV`→`FI` ticker change), which
  had left it with neither a real number nor an estimate. Its most recent
  annual revenue ($21.193B) was pulled instead from
  `yf.Ticker('FISV').income_stmt` (a real, non-fabricated Yahoo Finance
  figure, just from a different endpoint) and manually added to
  `financials_cache.csv`, which let `estimate_tier2.py` produce a normal
  revenue-based Tier 2 estimate for it like any other company.
- **223 / 503 companies (~44%)** matched to an SBTi record.
- **67 / 503 companies (~13%)** matched to a Climate TRACE Power-sector
  asset-ownership record.
- **470 / 503 companies (~93%)** matched to an Upright Net Impact record
  (fifth pass, 2026-09-13). Upright's source JSON has 505 companies, not
  503 — a handful are stale (companies since acquired, taken private, or
  removed from the index: e.g. Hess→Chevron, Discover Financial→Capital
  One, Pioneer Natural Resources→ExxonMobil, Electronic Arts taken
  private) and were correctly left unmatched rather than force-matched,
  per this project's hard scope constraint that every row must be a
  *current* S&P 500 constituent — see `docs/UPRIGHT_DATA_VERIFICATION.md`
  for independent, third-party (Wikipedia) confirmation of exactly which
  companies these are and why. See
  `pipeline/upright/match_upright.py`'s `UPRIGHT_NAME_ALIASES` table for
  the ~39 hand-verified same-company name differences that *were* safely
  resolved (e.g. Upright's "CISCO SYSTEMS" ↔ our constituent list's
  "Cisco"), and `UPRIGHT_MULTI_CLASS_ALIASES` for 3 more (Alphabet, Fox
  Corporation, News Corp) that were resolved by applying one company's
  Upright record to **both** of its share-class tickers (e.g. `GOOGL` and
  `GOOG`) — legitimate because these are one operating business with
  multiple stock classes, not two different companies. Honeywell and
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise remain unmatched **by a real Upright
  record** on purpose: unlike the three above, both are genuinely
  **separate businesses now** (Honeywell split into two independent
  companies in 2026; HP split into HP Inc. and HPE in 2015), so a single
  pre-split score can't be safely applied to either half.
- **All 33 remaining tickers (503 − 470) are now covered by a PROXY
  ESTIMATE instead** (`pipeline/upright/upright_estimates.csv`, built by
  `pipeline/upright/estimate_upright_gaps.py`) — **full 503/503 coverage
  on the Upright dimension, matching the CO2 side.** This is a
  peer-median stand-in (same GICS sector/sub-industry cascade as the
  Tier 2 CO2 model), **not Upright's real methodology or output** —
  tagged `upright_is_estimated=True` specifically so it's never
  presented as if Upright itself produced it. `upright_revenue_musd` /
  `upright_employee_count` on these rows are each company's own real
  `yfinance` data (not estimated) — only the cents-per-dollar-of-revenue
  metrics are peer-median proxies.
- **Found in the course of this matching**: `sp500_constituents.csv` has
  a literal stray `|` character in ResMed's `Security` field
  (`"ResMed|"`), which silently blocked a normal name match until it was
  special-cased. Worth cleaning up at the source — every other script
  that reads that column (SBTi, Climate TRACE matching) may be similarly
  affected for this one ticker.

## Columns

### Identity

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ticker` | Stock ticker, as listed in the S&P 500. |
| `security` | Company name as used in our source ticker lists (may differ slightly from the company's own legal name). |

### Level — raw disclosed emissions

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `data_source` | Where the numbers below came from: `cdp_pdf` (a CDP climate-change questionnaire PDF), `sustainability_report` (a company sustainability/ESG/impact report, lower confidence than CDP), `epa_ghgrp` (matched via EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program — real government data, but **Scope 1 only**, see caveat below), or `none` (searched, nothing public found). |
| `report_url` | The actual PDF URL the numbers were extracted from (or matched from, for EPA). Blank for EPA rows with no PDF (`epa_ghgrp`'s value comes from a government database, not a document). |
| `scope1_tco2e` | Direct emissions (Scope 1), in metric tons CO2-equivalent. Blank if not found/extracted. |
| `scope2_location_tco2e` | Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, **location-based** method (grid average), in tCO2e. |
| `scope2_market_tco2e` | Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, **market-based** method (accounts for renewable energy purchases/certificates) — usually lower than location-based for companies buying clean power. |
| `scope1_base_year_end` | The company's stated baseline year for its Scope 1 reduction target (e.g. `12/31/2019`), when disclosed. |
| `scope1_base_year_tco2e` | Scope 1 emissions in that base year — lets you compute how far a company has moved from its own stated starting point. |
| `revenue_usd` | Annual revenue as stated in the same document (mainly present for CDP PDFs, which ask for it directly) — useful for computing emissions intensity (tCO2e / $ revenue). |
| `is_cdp_format` | Internal parser flag: `new`, `old`, or `False` — which CDP questionnaire layout the parser recognized, if any. Not a data-quality signal by itself (occasionally `new` shows up on a non-CDP document that merely *mentions* CDP — see `notes` and the pipeline README for one confirmed case). |
| `notes` | Free text: extraction problems (`no_fields_extracted`, `download_error: ...`), or — for manually-entered rows — a full explanation of how the number was verified against the source document's own internal totals. **Always read this before trusting a row that looks unusual.** |

**EPA GHGRP caveat**: `epa_ghgrp` rows only ever populate `scope1_tco2e`.
EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a registry of direct emitters
(facilities emitting ≥25,000 tCO2e/yr must report), not a corporate
disclosure framework — it has no Scope 2 concept at all. Never treat a
blank `scope2_*` on an `epa_ghgrp` row as "zero" or "not disclosed" — it
means "this source doesn't cover that scope."

**Reading `data_source` vs. actually having a number**: `data_source` in
{`cdp_pdf`, `sustainability_report`} means a real report was found and a
genuine extraction attempt was made — it does **not** guarantee
`scope1_tco2e` etc. are populated. Check `notes` for
`no_fields_extracted` or `download_error` to see whether that attempt
actually yielded a number. `data_source=epa_ghgrp` rows always have a
number (that's the point of the match) but only for `scope1_tco2e`.

### Level — ESTIMATED emissions (Tier 2, per-scope independent)

For any ticker missing a real value for a **specific scope**, this
pipeline fills in an **estimate for that scope only** — never a
substitute for real data, and never applied on top of a real number.
Modeled on LSEG's published carbon-estimate "median model": take the
median emissions intensity (tCO2e per $ revenue, and separately per
employee) among real S&P 500 peers **that have a real value for that
same scope**, in the same GICS sector/sub-industry, then scale it by the
target company's own revenue/employee count. Scope 1 and Scope 2 each
get their own independent peer pool, median, and estimate — a row can
have a real Scope 1 and an estimated Scope 2 side by side.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scope1_is_estimated` / `scope2_is_estimated` | **`True`/`False` per scope — the columns to key color-coding off of.** `True` means that specific scope's figure (read `tier2_scope{1,2}_tco2e`, not `scope{1,2}_*_tco2e`, when `True`) is a Tier 2 estimate, not a disclosure. Independent of each other. |
| `is_estimated` | Backward-compatible summary flag: `True` if *either* scope is estimated. Kept for anything still keying off the old single flag — prefer the per-scope columns above for anything new. |
| `tier2_scope1_tco2e` | Estimated Scope 1, in tCO2e. Only meaningful when `scope1_is_estimated=True`; blank otherwise (the real value is in `scope1_tco2e` instead). |
| `tier2_scope1_method` / `tier2_scope1_sector_used` / `tier2_scope1_peer_count` / `tier2_scope1_notes` | Same meaning as the Scope 2 equivalents below, for the Scope 1 estimate. |
| `tier2_scope2_tco2e` | Estimated Scope 2, in tCO2e (approximates whichever of market-/location-based the peer group predominantly reported — see notes). Only meaningful when `scope2_is_estimated=True`. |
| `tier2_scope2_method` | Which inputs were available: `median_model_revenue`, `median_model_employees`, or `median_model_revenue+employees` (averaged, matching LSEG's approach of averaging both methods when both are available). |
| `tier2_scope2_sector_used` | Which peer group actually supplied the median, e.g. `sub_industry:Semiconductors` or `sector:Information Technology` — the model widens from sub-industry to sector (and finally to the whole S&P 500) if the narrower group doesn't have enough real-data peers for that scope (`tier2_scope2_peer_count`). |
| `tier2_scope2_peer_count` | How many real-data (Tier 1) companies with a real Scope 2 value were in that peer group. |
| `tier2_scope2_notes` | The full arithmetic: which ratios were used, what they were multiplied by, and the resulting estimate. Read this before citing a specific estimated number anywhere. |

**This is genuinely an estimate, not a disclosure** — two S&P 500
companies in the same GICS sub-industry can have very different actual
emissions profiles even at similar revenue, so treat any individual
`tier2_*` number as directionally informative, not a substitute for the
real figure this pipeline was never able to find.

### Velocity — Science Based Targets initiative status

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sbti_matched` | `True`/`False` — whether this ticker matched an SBTi record by exact normalized company name (same conservative, no-fuzzy-matching approach used for EPA GHGRP — a false match risks attributing the wrong company's target). |
| `sbti_near_term_status` | `Targets set` (validated by SBTi), `Committed` (pledged to submit a target, not yet validated), `Commitment removed` (had a target, then withdrew or let it lapse — a real, meaningful signal; Tesla and Amazon are both in this state as of this pull), or blank if unmatched. |
| `sbti_near_term_target_classification` | The ambition level of the target, e.g. `1.5°C` or `Well-below 2°C` — which warming pathway the target is consistent with. |
| `sbti_near_term_target_year` | The year the company's near-term target is due (e.g. `2030`, or `FY2030` for a fiscal-year target). |
| `sbti_long_term_status` | Same status vocabulary as `sbti_near_term_status`, but for the company's long-term (typically 2040-2050) target, if any. |
| `sbti_long_term_target_year` | Target year for the long-term target. |
| `sbti_net_zero_status` | Whether the company has a validated net-zero commitment specifically (distinct from a near/long-term reduction target). |
| `sbti_net_zero_year` | The year the company commits to reach net zero. |
| `sbti_full_target_language` | The exact free-text description SBTi publishes for this company's target — usually states the precise % reduction and base year in plain language (e.g. "commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions 50.4% by 2032 from a 2024 base year"). This is the most information-dense field — worth reading directly rather than relying only on the structured columns above. |
| `sbti_date_updated` | When SBTi last updated this company's record. |

### Integrity — Climate TRACE independent Power-sector ownership

Independent of anything the company self-reports: Climate TRACE estimates
emissions from satellite/sensor observation of physical assets, then
separately publishes who owns each asset. These columns say whether an
S&P 500 company shows up as an owner of Power-sector assets Climate TRACE
tracks — **not** an independent re-measurement of the company's total
Scope 1/2 emissions (that would require joining this ownership data
against Climate TRACE's separate Emissions package by `source_id`, which
wasn't completed this session — see `pipeline/README.md`).

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `climatetrace_power_matched` | `True`/`False` — whether this ticker appears as a parent owner of any Power-sector asset in Climate TRACE's data. |
| `climatetrace_power_asset_count` | How many distinct Power-sector assets (plants) this company appears as an owner of, anywhere in the world. |
| `climatetrace_power_subsectors` | Which Power subsectors these assets fall into (e.g. `electricity-generation`), semicolon-separated. |
| `climatetrace_power_countries` | ISO3 country codes of the assets' locations, semicolon-separated. |
| `climatetrace_power_avg_share_percent` | The company's average ownership share across its matched assets, 0-100. **Read this before treating a match as meaningful**: utilities like Duke Energy (`DUK`) average ~92% (real operational ownership), while asset managers like BlackRock (`BLK`, 1,862 assets, ~5.2% avg share) and State Street (`STT`, 1,066 assets, ~3.1% avg share) show up because of small index-fund equity stakes, not operational control — a completely different signal that a naive "asset count" alone would conflate. |

### Upright — a separate teammate dataset (monetized impact, NOT tCO2e)

**Read this before using any `upright_*` column.** Upright's Net Impact
Model measures modeled, monetized externalities in **cents per dollar of
revenue** — e.g. `-15.2` means "this company's environmental impact costs
society an estimated 15.2 cents for every dollar of revenue it earns."
That is not a physical emissions quantity and cannot be added to,
divided by, or plotted on the same axis as `scope1_tco2e` or
`tier2_scope1_tco2e` anywhere in this file.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `upright_matched` | `True`/`False` — whether this ticker matched an Upright record by exact (or hand-verified-alias) company name. |
| `upright_company_name` | The company name as it appears in Upright's own export (often an informal short name, e.g. `WALMART`). |
| `upright_industry` | Upright's own industry label for the company (their own classification, not GICS). |
| `upright_revenue_musd` | Revenue in millions of USD, as used by Upright's own model (their own data source, not `yfinance` — may differ slightly from `revenue_usd` or Tier 2's financials). |
| `upright_employee_count` | Employee count per Upright. |
| `upright_net_impact_ratio_percent` | `(positive impact − negative impact) / positive impact`, as a percentage, across *all four* categories combined — Upright's single top-line "is this company net-positive or net-negative for the world" number. |
| `upright_rank_top_percent` | The company's percentile rank (Upright's own methodology) — check `upright_url` for the precise definition before citing this number, it wasn't independently re-derived here. |
| `upright_environment_cost_cents_per_dollar` / `upright_environment_benefit_cents_per_dollar` | Total Environment-category cost/benefit (cents per dollar of revenue) — the broadest environmental figure Upright publishes, covering GHG emissions, non-GHG emissions, resource use, biodiversity, and waste combined. |
| `upright_ghg_emissions_cost_cents_per_dollar` / `upright_ghg_emissions_benefit_cents_per_dollar` | The GHG-emissions-specific slice of the Environment category. Still cents/$ revenue, **not tCO2e** — this is the column most likely to be confused with this file's real emissions data, so don't be. |
| `upright_non_ghg_emissions_cost_cents_per_dollar` | Non-GHG environmental cost (e.g. other pollution), same unit. |
| `upright_society_cost_cents_per_dollar` / `_benefit_...` | Society-category total (jobs, taxes, equality & human rights, etc.) — likely more relevant to a teammate's Economic Resilience or Transition Readiness pillar than to this Environmental section. |
| `upright_health_cost_cents_per_dollar` / `_benefit_...` | Health-category total (e.g. product health impacts). |
| `upright_knowledge_cost_cents_per_dollar` / `_benefit_...` | Knowledge-category total (R&D, education contributions). |
| `upright_largest_cost` / `upright_largest_benefit` | Free text naming the company's single largest negative/positive impact driver and a rough physical-unit figure when Upright provides one (e.g. `"GHG emissions 110M tons of GHG emissions"` for Walmart) — **only present when that specific category happens to be the company's single largest**, so this text field cannot be read as "GHG tonnage for every company" (only ~152 of 505 Upright rows happen to have GHG as their top driver). |
| `upright_url` | Link to the company's full profile on Upright's platform, for anything not captured in these summary columns. Blank on a PROXY-ESTIMATED row (no such page exists for our own estimate). |
| `upright_is_estimated` | **`True`/`False` — the second color-coding flag in this file.** `True` means every `upright_*` cents-per-dollar figure on this row is OUR OWN peer-median proxy (see below), not real Upright output. Independent of the main `is_estimated` column (that one is about tCO2e, this one is about Upright's metrics) — a single row can be `True`/`True`, `True`/`False`, `False`/`True`, or `False`/`False`. |
| `upright_peer_group_used` | Which peer group supplied the median on an estimated row, e.g. `sector:Communication Services` — same sub_industry→sector→global cascade as the Tier 2 CO2 model. Blank on a real-match row. |
| `upright_peer_count` | How many real Upright-covered peers were in that group. Blank on a real-match row. |
| `upright_estimate_notes` | Explains the estimate is a crude industry-average proxy, not Upright's real company-specific modeling, and that `upright_revenue_musd`/`upright_employee_count` on that row are the company's own real financials, not estimated. Blank on a real-match row. |

## Known data-quality flags worth reading before using a specific row

A few rows have unusual circumstances noted in `notes` — worth knowing
about before citing them:

- **VMRK (Vivmark Residential)**: this ticker is the August 2026 merger
  of AvalonBay Communities and Equity Residential. The entered figure is
  **AvalonBay's own pre-merger CDP data only** — roughly half the
  combined company's real footprint, not a combined-entity disclosure
  (none exists yet).
- **NKE (Nike), WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery), CRM (Salesforce), SJM
  (J.M. Smucker), TDY (Teledyne)**: these five were entered **manually**
  rather than by the automated parser, because their reports use
  one-off table layouts the general-purpose parser can't safely
  generalize from (risk of grabbing the wrong year, wrong sub-metric, or
  a decoy row). Each was cross-verified against that same document's own
  internal arithmetic (e.g. summed sub-totals matching a stated grand
  total) before being entered — see each row's `notes` for the exact
  verification performed.

See `pipeline/README.md` for the full collection methodology and the
project's "never fabricate a number" rule.

## `environmental_scores.csv` — column reference

One row per S&P 500 ticker (503 rows), sorted best-to-worst by
`environmental_composite_score`. Built by
`pipeline/scoring/compute_environmental_scores.py` from
`environmental_combined.csv` above. **This file has no raw tCO2e
numbers of its own** — `level_intensity_tco2e_per_usd` is the one
exception, everything else here is a 0–100 score or a label explaining
how that score was reached. Full formulas: `docs/SCORE_METHODOLOGY.md`.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ticker` / `security` / `gics_sector` | Identity, same as `environmental_combined.csv`. |
| `level_score` | 0–100, current emissions intensity vs. sector peers. 100 = cleanest in sector, 0 = dirtiest. |
| `level_intensity_tco2e_per_usd` | The raw intensity value (`(scope1+scope2)/revenue`) `level_score` was computed from — the one non-score number in this file, useful for recomputing or sanity-checking the score. |
| `scope1_is_estimated` / `scope2_is_estimated` | Carried over from `environmental_combined.csv` — whether the intensity feeding `level_score` used a real or Tier 2 estimated figure for each scope. |
| `velocity_score` | 0–100, is the company decarbonizing fast enough. |
| `velocity_basis` | Which tier produced the score: `measured_trend` (a real multi-year Scope 1 comparison vs. SBTi's required pace), `target_ambition` (no real trend, scored from SBTi target status/classification instead), or `no_commitment` (no SBTi match at all, fixed low score). **Read this before comparing two velocity_score values** — a 50 from `measured_trend` and a 50 from `target_ambition` are not the same kind of evidence. |
| `velocity_details` | The actual arithmetic or points breakdown behind the score on this row — e.g. the observed vs. required annual reduction rate, or the SBTi points earned per criterion. |
| `integrity_score` | 0–100, can this company's number be trusted. |
| `integrity_disclosure_quality` | The sub-score from source tier (CDP > sustainability report > EPA > estimated) and completeness (both scopes real, base year stated, dual Scope 2 reporting). |
| `integrity_cross_source_agreement` | The sub-score from comparing this company's percentile rank in our own emissions-intensity data against its percentile rank in Upright's independently-modeled GHG-cost data — blank if no real Upright record exists for this ticker (falls back to disclosure quality alone). |
| `integrity_basis` | `with_cross_validation` (both sub-scores blended) or `disclosure_quality_only` (no real Upright data to cross-check against). |
| `environmental_composite_score` | The final score: `(level_score + velocity_score + integrity_score) / 3`. This is the number to use for an overall ranking. |

## `sp500_metrics.json` — structure reference

One JSON object per current S&P 500 ticker (503 records), the shape a
website would actually consume. Built by `pipeline/build_website_json.py`.
Every record has this shape:

```
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "security": "Apple Inc.",
  "gics_sector": "...", "gics_sub_industry": "...", "headquarters_location": "...",

  "co2": {
    "data_source": "...", "report_url": "...", "notes": "...",
    "is_estimated": false,   // true if EITHER scope below is estimated (summary flag)
    "scope1": { "tco2e": 55200.0, "is_estimated": false, "estimate": null },
    "scope2": {
      "location_tco2e": 1206700.0, "market_tco2e": 3400.0,
      "tco2e": 3400.0,             // market preferred over location when both real; the value actually used for scoring
      "is_estimated": false, "estimate": null
    }
    // when is_estimated is true for a scope, "estimate" holds
    // {method, sector_used, peer_count, notes} instead of null
  },

  "sbti": { "matched": true, "near_term_status": "...", "near_term_target_classification": "...", ... },
  "climate_trace": { "matched": false },

  "upright": {
    // when real (upright.is_estimated == false): the teammate's ORIGINAL
    // Upright record verbatim -- company, industry, revenue_musd,
    // employee_count, net_impact_ratio, rank_top_percent, category_totals
    // (Environment/Health/Knowledge/Society cost+benefit), metrics (18
    // granular sub-metrics), largest_cost, largest_benefit, upright_url.
    // NOT tCO2e -- cents per dollar of revenue, a different unit entirely.

    // when estimated (upright.is_estimated == true): our own peer-median
    // proxy in the same shape, but only 2 of the 18 metrics are populated
    // (GHG emissions, Non-GHG emissions -- the only ones we estimate),
    // largest_cost/largest_benefit/upright_url are null, and
    // estimate_method/estimate_peer_group/estimate_peer_count/estimate_notes
    // are added.
    "is_estimated": false
  },

  "scores": {
    "level_score": 100.0, "level_intensity_tco2e_per_usd": 1.26e-07,
    "velocity_score": 0.0, "velocity_basis": "measured_trend", "velocity_details": "...",
    "integrity_score": 86.9, "integrity_disclosure_quality": 100.0,
    "integrity_cross_source_agreement": 67.4, "integrity_basis": "with_cross_validation",
    "environmental_composite_score": 62.3
  }
}
```

Every field's meaning matches its equivalent flat-CSV column above
(`co2.scope1.tco2e` ≈ `environmental_combined.csv`'s `scope1_tco2e`,
`scores.level_score` ≈ `environmental_scores.csv`'s `level_score`, etc.)
— this doc's CSV column tables above are the reference for what each
value actually means; this section is just the JSON shape they're
nested into. `data/upright_final_esg.json` (the teammate's raw source)
is a separate file, never modified by this pipeline.
